Client needs to:
  Get file's source /<path>/<filename>
  Get file's destination /<path>/<filename>
  Create file_id (24-bit id=yy[8],mm[4],dd[5],ss[6],us[1]) per file transfer.

Initiation Header needs to have:
  file name tag,
  destination /<path>/<filename>
  number of text lines to transfer for current file

1. Server listens for init packet.
2. Client sends init packet specifying next parameters using these fields: 
    A. current_line: specifies the desired timeout value in seconds.
    B. total_lines: number of files to be sent so server can allocate memory per each file.
    C. init: is set to specify that this packet is an init packet.
    D. file_id: set to all 1's to specify this is a transfer init packet (server ignores duplciates if received during transfer).
    E. pay load: containing file_id fields for each file to be trasnferred trailed by the destination <path/filename>
3. Server upon receival of the above packet:
    A. creates an array[total_lines] of structures. 
    B. a creation of an array of structures with next fields:
        i. file_id set to all vaues received in init packet.
        ii. line pointers pointing to NULLs.
        iii. expected lines record mask pointer set to NULL
        iv.  received line record mask pointer set to null
        v. all_done field set to 0.
    C*. replies with a copy of the same packet (dup requests are ignored) but:
        i. without a payload.
        ii. ack: is set.
        iii. current_line: specifies the timeout value in seconds granted by the server.
4. Client starts sending packets with fields set to next values (and listens for an ACK requesting repeat; or FIN confirming receival of the data):
    file_id:          {min[6],sec[6],file[4]} up to 16 files.
    current_line[16]: specifies the line's number.
    total_lines[16]:  specifies the total number of lines per current file.
    pay load:         containing the actual line
5. For each packet(4) received, server:
    A. Check if INIT; if init respond with ACK
    B. CHeck if FIN and ACK are set; if YES but not all data received; terminate with error.
    C. If data received, check the file number and file ID and see if all lines for file number already received
       If not, check if the line already received, if not store the line.
    D. Check if all received is set, if yes, send FIN and wait until client responds with FIN|ACK packet to terminate; resend FIN if non FIN|ACK packet received.
    OTHER: Checks if an array's element with matching ID already exists:
        i If does not exist, performed on the server:
            a. a creation of an array of structures with next fields:
                I.   set file_id to the file_id of the received packet.
                II.  an array of char * line_pointers[total_lines] where each pointer points to allocated memory storing the text. 
                III. a pointer to "expected lines record mask" and set the bits based on total_lines value!
                IV.  a pointer to "recieved lines record mask" and initialize to 0
                V.   all_done field indicating successfule comparison of the 2 fields above!
            b. allocation a memory of size (total_lines/8+1) for "expected lines record mask" and "received lines record mask"
        ii. if exists or d.n. exist
            a. allocate memory to store the string and set the appropriate line_pointer.
            b. set the appropriate bit in the "received lines record mask"
            c. compare the "received lines record mask" against "expected lines record mask" and set the all_done field appropriately.
            e. check if all "all_done" fiels are set indicating successful transfer; if yes then send FIN; if no and timeout occured, send ACK to request repetition.



State1: Server awaits a connection request and init packet.

State2: Client sends init packet to Server:
    file_id[16]: {yy[8]+mm[4]+dd[5] , ss[6]} = {date[10],ss[6]}  per file transfer.
    lines[16]:    number of text lines to be transmitted (so the server know how much space to allocate)
    payload_size[16]:current payload size.
    tx_ordered[1]: client requests a tx method but upto server to decide which one it prefers.
        1-send burst of packets each packet containing a single line; 
        0-wait for acks from Servers used by server to request a line.
    reserved[15]
    payload: full path to file as the payload.

State3: Server received the init packet:
    Server registers file_id
    Server registers tx_ordered (only tx_ordered 0 is implemented for now)
    Servers tries to allocate memory (if unsucc; respond with abort; lines[16]=0)
    Server checks the desired destination using init packet's payload info (if directory d.n. exist or fail to open a file in general, respond with abort; lines[16]=0)
    Server responds with the same packet used as an ack  (setting the lines[16] value to 0 to indicate an abort)

State4: Client receives the ack packet 
    Checks the file_id to determine to what file transfer the ack corresponds.
    Client checks the tx_ordered to see if Server agreeed to use the desired method or insists on Server's method.
    Client sends a burst of packets, or sends one packet/line at the time looking for Server to ack each delivery with response (response same as State3 packet but lines=<num of next line to be send by client>)
    The packets sent by client from this point use fields in this manner:
        file_id: stays the same
        lines: indicate a line number the payload contains.
        payload_size: as before.
        tx_ordered: don't care
        reserved: don't care
        payload: actual content of the line.
